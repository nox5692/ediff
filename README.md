# *ediff*: *E*xtended *diff*

---
### What does *ediff* bring to the table?
- Well known **diff** features,
- PNG image histogram comparison,
- CSS selector filescraping and comparison,
- Recursive directory comparison with recpect to file suffixes:
    - Example:
        ```
            Dir1:
                one.css
                flower.png
            Dir2:
                two.css
                house.png
        ```
    - **ediff** will match file suffixes and match them to their respective comparison methods.
